Notes
-----

Technical:

* It's made in Pages version 7.3; the ISO variant with Pages version 10.3.9
* The template is layed out as two tables in centimeters. 
* The width of a normal template (47cm/18.5") would exceed the size of _A3_ (it might fit diagonally), so it's printed in two parts on A4 format.
* The ISO version uses the [U001 font](https://www.cufonfonts.com/font/u001) as surrogate for the [Univers font](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Univers#Usage) used by Apple on the keyboards.

Usage:

* Page size is _A4_. Some countries might ajust page size.
* The "template holder pins" are marked by the lowercase letter `o` on the left and right of the template.
* On the ISO variant, the media keys are clustered as a group together, according to my (xenolog2) personal keyboard settings. It's easy to move them to the normal positions, if needed.

Look on this photo of an original template on [Flickr](https://www.flickr.com/photos/penmachine/2457661040/) (topmost picture)

Other photos of these templates seem rare, so you can find some in the [images](images/) folder. Here is an index:

And from doekmans personal collection (not for an AEK keyboard, but an overlay nonetheless) my (doekman) WordPerfect 6 overlays ([both DOS and Windows; PDF](images/WordPerfect6_DOS_and_Windows_Overlay.pdf)):
